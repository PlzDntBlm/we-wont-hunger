## About The Project

"We Won't Hunger" is a solo development passion project aiming to create a modern, more detailed take on the colony simulation and RTS genres. The core pillar of the game is the deep simulation of individual agents—each with their own needs, skills, and lifecycle—as they work to build and sustain a thriving medieval settlement.

This repository tracks the development from the earliest prototypes to the full, feature-rich vision.

## Key Features

The long-term goal is to build a game with the following features:

* **Deep Agent Simulation:**
    * A complex system of needs, including hunger, thirst, rest, and more.
    * A full lifecycle where agents are born, grow, learn skills, age, and eventually pass away.
    * A dynamic system for moods, happiness, and social relationships.
    * A robust job and profession management system.
* **Detailed Building & Economy:**
    * Freeform placement of buildings, walls, and defensive structures.
    * Complex resource production chains, requiring raw materials to be processed into usable goods.
* **Strategic RTS Gameplay:**
    * A real-time combat system for defending your settlement.
    * An objective and scenario system to provide structured goals.
* **Immersive Features:**
    * A first-person view to walk around your settlement from an agent's perspective.
    * A powerful map editor for creating and sharing custom scenarios.

## Current Status: Prototyping

The project is currently in the **early prototyping phase**. The focus is on building and validating the core gameplay loops one by one before adding graphical polish or complexity.

## Roadmap

The high-level development plan is managed on our GitHub Projects Kanban board.
